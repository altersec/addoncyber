Any feedback and PR welcomed!

Current options:
  * [Talos Reputation](https://talosintelligence.com/)
  * [Virus Total](https://developers.virustotal.com/reference/search-1) - requires API key
  * [OTX](https://otx.alienvault.com/)

NOTE: Some options may require authenticated access.
Services that require an API key (like VT) use the PHP script in the extra folder hosted by alterSec.
Users should host their own instance on public web server, configured with your specific VT API key.

## Getting Started

Clone the github repo to a local folder and [Sideload extension in Edge](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/extensions-chromium/getting-started/extension-sideloading)
