AddonCyber is a simple open-source browser extension to assist SOC teams, cybersecurity researchers and analysts in day-to-day threat inteligence and security operations. 

Using a browser, highlight the indicator: IP, URL, domain, file hash, CVE number, base64 encoded text, and opt to search various threat intel services for the IOC, search for a CVE, decode base64, etc
